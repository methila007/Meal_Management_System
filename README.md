# Meal_Management_System
This meal management system is a systematic approach to bring discipline in the management of meals in a hostel i.e. it makes sure that everyone is contributing equally, not more not less. The average meal value of the day, how much one needs to contribute, everything is shown in a tabular form.
All the other files are included in Meal_Management.rar MVC is used in this, and everything is included in the rar file. the sevver that i used for this was apache tomcat and xampp.
